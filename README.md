# Sorting algorithms visualization

I will we doing visualization of working of sorting algorithms. In this project I will be working with selection sort, merge sort and quick sort.

## Selection sort

I have created a recursive selection sorting algorithm. This algorithm basically works by swaping the value of the first element with the smallest valued element on the array, which later is slice excluding the first element and doing it recursively until the array's length is lesser then two.
